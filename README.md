# SecureADODB Fork
I started working on SecureADODB to
 - practice VBA OOP, extending both my understanding and practicall skill
 - deeply learn the original SecureADODB project
 - to see if I can identify improvement opportunities and implement them.

So, this project is largely a learning exercise for me, but I also plan to use it in another project, which can benefit from an ADODB VBA library.  
 
 ## Class diagram and mapping to ADODB

The class diagram below shows the core SecureADODB classes (this fork, blue) and the mapping to the core ADODB classes (green).

DbRecordset class has been added in this fork, while DbManager class shown at the bottom is functionally similar to the UnitOfWork class from the base project.
DbManager implements typical workflow and is, thus, responsible for streamlining the interaction process with the database. Since SecureADODB library has been designed in such a way to ensure maximal decoupling of classes responsible for different functions, an additional class UoF/DbManager is usefull to put it all together. It takes connection parameters or connection string and then instantiates other classes and taking care of injecting dependencies as necessary.

DbConnection and DbRecordset classes recieve and hadle events generated by the corresponding ADODB classes (which was part of the motivation for creating DbRecordset class). While the most important events from ADODB.Connection are probably those related to connection/execution/transaction and related error events, events generated by the ADODB.Recordset among other things facilitate asynchronous fetching, which is something I might explore in the future.
