# SecureADODB Fork
I started working on SecureADODB to
 - practice VBA OOP, extending both my understanding and practicall skill
 - deeply learn the original SecureADODB project
 - to see if I can identify improvement opportunities and implement them.

So, this project is largely a learning exercise for me, but I also plan to use it in another project, which can benefit from an ADODB VBA library.
