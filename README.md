# SecureADODB Fork
I started working on SecureADODB to
 - practice VBA OOP, extending both my understanding and practical skill
 - deeply learn the original SecureADODB project
 - to see if I can identify improvement opportunities and implement them.

So, this project is largely a learning exercise for me, but I also plan to use it in another project, which can benefit from an ADODB VBA library.  
 
 ## Class diagram and mapping to ADODB

The class diagram below shows the core SecureADODB classes (this fork, blue) and the mapping to the core ADODB classes (green).

DbRecordset class has been added in this fork, while DbManager class shown at the bottom is functionally similar to the UnitOfWork class from the base project.
DbManager implements typical workflow and is, thus, responsible for streamlining the interaction process with the database. Since SecureADODB library has been designed in such a way to ensure maximal decoupling of classes responsible for different functions, an additional class UoF/DbManager is useful to put it all together. It takes connection parameters or connection string and then instantiates other classes and taking care of injecting dependencies as necessary.

DbConnection and DbRecordset classes receive and handle events generated by the corresponding ADODB classes (which was part of the motivation for creating DbRecordset class). While the most important events from ADODB.Connection are probably those related to connection/execution/transaction and related error events, events generated by the ADODB.Recordset among other things facilitate asynchronous fetching, which is something I might explore in the future.

## Summary of the core differences from the base project

1.  A coupling loop between DbConnection and DbCommand has been removed (issue [IDbConnection_CreateCommand interface](https://github.com/pchemguy/RDVBA-examples/issues/14)).
2.  AutoDbCommand and DefaultDbCommand have been replace with DbCommand, and DefaultDbCommandFactory with DbCommandFactory.
    DbCommand always takes an existing DbConnection as a dependency, and is only responsible for ExecuteNoQuery functionality ([NoQuery flag](https://github.com/pchemguy/RDVBA-examples/commit/ffc12ffb361ecc5a2338a321d84e8a756b48e109) commit), while queries returning a Recordset or a scalar are executed via the DbRecordset class.
3.  DbManager takes a flag indicating whether transactions should be used. Additionally, an error handler has been added to the BeginTransaction method. If this handler traps an error, it sets a flag on DbConnection object disabling further transaction handling.
4.  Class design patterns.
    1) Factory-constructor pattern. Following the convention of the base project, Create method is used as the default concrete factory method on default class instances. Initialization, on the other hand is not performed by a set of public setters, but rather via a corresponding constructor ([Factory-Constructor pattern](https://github.com/pchemguy/RDVBA-examples/issues/11) issue).
    2) Abstract factory and CreateInstance convention. Further, when abstract factory pattern is used, factory's Create method generate factory instances, whereas CreateInstance method called on a factory instances generates instances of the target class ([CreateInstance convention](https://github.com/pchemguy/RDVBA-examples/issues/10) issue).
    3) Duplicate Guard clauses. In several cases, there were duplicating checks by the Guard clauses, for example, the first happening in the factory method and subsequent checks in individual setters. The only Guard left in the factory class is the one checking for non-default instance invocation, which might be still somewhat redundant as well, if all instances always created against non-default interfaces, which lack the factory method. The received parameters are passed onto the corresponding constructor as is, where all parameters are validated once and in one place.
